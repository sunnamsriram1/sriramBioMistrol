Servers are often dedicated , meaning that they perform no other tasks \\nbesides their server tasks like accepts and responds to requests made by another \\nprogram, known as a client.  \\nClient : A client is an application that runs on a personal computer or \\nworkstation and relies on a serve r to perform some operations. The client \\naccesses the server by way of a network.  \\nDevices : Computer devices, such as a CD -ROM drive or printer, that is \\nnot part of the essential computer. Examples of devices include disk drives, \\nprinters, and modems.  \\nHub : Hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple devices \\nand making them act as a single network segment. A hub works at the physical \\nlayer of the OSI model.  \\nSwitch : A device that filters and forwards packets between LAN \\nsegments. Switches  operate at the data link layer and  sometimes the network \\nlayer of the OSI Reference Model.  \\nRouter : A router is a device that  is capable of forwarding data packets on \\na network . Routers are placed  at the junction  (gateway)  of two or more \\nnetworks connect . Routers use headers and forwarding tables to determine the \\nbest path for forwarding the packets.  \\n  Bridge : Bridge is a computer networking device that connects a local \\narea network (LAN) to another local area network tha t uses the same protocol.  \\nAccess Point : A hardware device or a computer's software that acts as a \\ncommunication hub for users to connect all their wireless device.  \\n \\nTypes of Networks  \\n \\nLocal area network (LAN)  \\nA LAN is a network that connects computers  and devices in a limited \\ngeographical area such as a home, school, office building.  \\nWide area network (WAN)  \\nA WAN  is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such \\nas a city, country, or spans even inter continental distances. A WAN uses a \\ncommunications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone \\nlines,  ethernet cables, optical fibers , etc. \"),\n",

MANs rarely extend beyond 100 KM \\nand comprise a combination of different hardware and transmission media.  \\nWireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  \\nWireless local area networks provide wireless network communication \\nover shor t distances using radio or infrared signals instead of traditional \\nnetwork cabling. WLAN s are built by attaching a device called the access point  \\nto the edge of the wired network. Clients communicate with the AP using a \\nwireless network adapter similar in f unction to a traditional Ethernet adapter.  \\nVirtual private network (VPN)  \\nThe v irtual  private network is an overlay network in which some of the \\nlinks between nodes are carried by virtual circuits  in the network  instead of \\nphysical wires.

The physical layer covers a variety of \\ndevices an d mediums, among them cabling, connectors, receivers, transceivers , \\nand repeaters.  \\nLayer 2: Data Link Layer  \\nThis layer sets up links across the physical network, putting packets into \\nnetwork frames. This layer has two sublayers the logical link control lay er and \\nthe media access control layer (MAC). MAC layer types include Ethernet and \\n802.11 wireless specifications.  \\nLayer 3: Network Layer  \\nThis layer handles addressing and routing the data. To transfer it from the \\nright source to the right destination. The IP address is part of the network  layer.  \\nLayer 4: Transport Layer  \\nThis layer manages packetization of data, then the delivery of the packets, \\nincluding checking for errors in the data once it arrives. On the internet, TCP \\nand UDP provide these services for most a pplications.  \\nLayer 5: Session Layer  \\nThe session layer controls the connections between computers. It \\nestablishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and \\nremote application.  \\nLayer 6: Presentation Layer  \\nThis layer is usually part of an  operating system (OS) and converts \\nincoming and outgoing data from one presentation format to another for \\nexample, from clear text to encrypted text at one end and back to clear text at \\nthe other.  \\nLayer 7: Application Layer  \\nThe application layer of the OSI model interacts with the end user. \\nProtocols at this layer handle  the requests from different software applications. \\nIf a web browser wants to download an image, an email client wants to check \\nthe server , and a file -sharing program wants  to upload a movie, t he protocols in \\nthe application layer will process those requests.  \\n \\nIP address  \\nAn Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to \\neach device connected to a computer network.

IPv4 is the most widely deployed Internet \\nprotocol used to connect devices to the Inter net. IPv4 uses a 32 -bit address \\nscheme allowing  a total of 2^32 addresses.  \\n \\nIPv6: Internet Protocol Version 6 is the newest version of the Internet Protocol  \\nreviewed in the IETF standards committees to replace the current version of \\nIPv4. IPv6 addresses are 128 -bit IP address written in hexadecimal and \\nseparated by colons. An example IPv6 address could be written like this 3 ffe: \\n1900:4545:3 :200: f 8ff: fe 21:67cf.  \\n \\nIP address classes  \\nThere are five classes of  IP addresse s, they are  Class A, Class B, Class C, Class \\nD and Class E,  where only A, B, and C are commonly used.  \\n \\nClass  Address Range  Supports  \\nClass A  1.0.0.1 to \\n126.255.255.254  Supports 16 million hosts on each \\nof 127 networks.  \\nClass B  128.1.0.1 to \\n191.255.255.254  Supports 65,000 hosts on each of \\n16,000 networks.  \\nClass C  192.0.1.1 to \\n223.255.254.254  Supports 254 hosts on each of 2 \\nmillion networks.  \\nClass D  224.0.0.0 to \\n239.255.255.255  Reserved for multicast groups.  \\nClass E  240.0.0.0 to \\n254.255.255.254  Reserved for future use, or Research \\nand Development Purposes.  \\n \\nSubnetwork (Subnet)    \\nA subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network.  Dividing a network \\ninto two or more networks is known as subnetting.

The benefits of supernetting are \\nconservation of address space, gaining efficiency regarding  memory storage and \\nroute information processing.  \\n \\nNetwork address translation  \\nNetwork address translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP \\naddress space into another by modifying network address information in IP \\nheader packets while they are in transit. It has become a popular and essential \\ntool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion.  \\n \\nDynamic Host Conf iguration Protocol  \\nThe Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network \\nmanagement protocol used on UDP/IP networks. A DHCP server dynamically \\nassigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each \\ndevice on a network  so that  they can communicate with other IP networks.  \\n \\nTCP  \\nTCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, which is a widely used \\nprotocol for data transmission over a network. TCP establishes a connection \\nbetween two hosts before transmitting data, to ensure that data transm itted over \\nthe network  reaches the destination  without fail. TCP also known as a \\nconnection -oriented  protocol, establishes  a reliable connection between sender \\nand receiver. TCP provides error and flow control mechanisms which help in \\norderly transmission of data a nd retransmission of lost packets.  \\n \\nUDP  \\nUDP stands for User Datagram Protocol, which is connectionless \\nprotocol, mostly used for connections that can tolerate data loss. UDP is used by \\napplications on the internet that offer voice and video communications,  which \\ncan suffer some data loss without adversely affecting the quality. UDP does not \\nprovide error and flow control mechanisms because of which it does not require \\na connection to be established before transmitting data over the network . \\n \\nICMP  \\nICMP stands fo r Internet Control Message Protocol ; this is widely used \\nfor internet communication troubleshooting or generated in response to errors in \\nIP operations, this will send packets to the target machine and will see whether \\nthe packets  are delivered  or not.  \\n '),\n",

This mapping is a critical function in the Internet \\nProtocol suite. It works within the boundaries of a single network never routed \\nacross internetworking nodes. ARP uses a simple message format containing \\none address resolution request or response. The size of the ARP message \\ndepends on the link layer and network layer address sizes.  \\n \\nDomain Name System  \\nDomain Name System (DNS) is a naming system for resources connected \\nto the Internet or a private network. The DNS is responsible for assigning \\ndomain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating \\nname servers for each domain.

IGMP is an integral part of IP multicast. IGMP \\ncan be used for one -to-many networking applications such as online video \\nstreaming and gami ng and allows the more  efficient use of resources.  \\n \\nRouting  \\nRouting is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or across \\nmultiple networks. In routing , network packets from their source toward their \\ndestination are routed through int ermediate network nodes by specific packet \\nforwarding mechanisms. Intermediate nodes are typically network ed hardware \\ndevices such as routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or switches. In routing , \\nprocess packets are directed  on based on routing tables, which maintain a record \\nof the routes to various network destinations. An administrator specifies the \\nrouting  table . \\n \\nRouting protocol  \\nRouting protocol specifies how routers communicate with each other, \\ndistributing information,  which  enables them to sel ect routes between any two \\nnodes on a computer network.

The new -\\nest pen-test distribution released by Of -\\nfensive Security which supersedes BackTrack \\ncomes with some massive and welcome im -\\nprovements. The biggest change from BackTrack \\nis the move from Ubuntu linux to Debian Wheezy \\nlinux. The first thing I notice is that the installa -\\ntion is no longer launched by executing a script \\non the Desktop as it was with BackTrack, but is \\ninitiated but booting into a proper Debian instal -\\nlation system. The process generally feels a lot \\nsmoother from the start. I have also noticed that \\nin general Kali doesn’t break as easily as Back -\\ntrack and it generally has a much more stable \\nfeel to it. So what’s the difference between Back -\\nTrack and Kali?\\nBackTrack 5 v Kali\\nUbuntu, which BackTrack is based on, has a gen -\\neral feel to it that it is trying to babysit you as the \\nuser, which can be annoying to an experienced \\nlinux user. Ubuntu likes to make everything user \\nfriendly and tries to cut out any complex configu -\\nrations. Debian, which Kali is based on, may not \\ncome across to be so ‘user friendly’ to someone \\nwho is not that experienced with linux, and re -\\nquires more hands on experience with linux, but \\nis generally more configurable and stable. Person -ally, I definitely prefer the Debian base for Kali as I \\nlike to tweak. This distribution is not for linux begin -\\nners in any case. \\nWhat Happened to Firefox? \\nOne of the first things I notice is that Firefox has \\nbeen replaced by Iceweasel. On first instance \\nthis might leave you wondering what Iceweasel is \\nand why it has replaced Firefox. The truth is that \\nIceweasel IS Firefox. The Debian project patch -\\nes Iceweasel by backporting security fixes, thus \\nmaking it secure enough to be declared in debi -\\nan stable version. Because this is the case they \\nhad to re-brand it Iceweasel as the modifications \\nmade by Debian project were not approved by the \\nMozilla foundation in order to use the Thunder -\\nburd logo. Other than backported security patch -\\nes and the logo, both Firefox and Iceweasel are \\nidentical. I would recommend staying with Ice -\\nweasel on Debian, but if you really want to use \\nFirefox you can install it in the following manner \\nby first uninstalling Iceweasel (Listing 1).\\nFHS-compliance and /pentest\\nAnother massive step in the right direction is FHS-\\ncompliance. File Hierarchy Standard (FHS) compli -\\nance specifies guiding principles for each part of the \\nfile system, and means that the directory structure \\nand file system is standardised such that software Kali Linux  \\n– What’s new?\\nKali Linux released earlier in the year is dubbed the most \\nadvanced penetration testing distribution, ever. How does it \\ncompare to BackTrack?, and: What’s the difference?\\n'),\n",

This will also \\nlead to a more stable system in general.\\nIn BackTrack, every pen-test tool which you \\nwanted to use you either had to express the full \\npathname to the tool e.g. /pentest/passwords/\\nrainbowcrack/rcrack  or change to the directory in \\norder to use it. Kali no longer uses the  /pentest  di-\\nrectory tree, and all command line pen-test tools \\nseem to be located in /usr/bin . Pen-test tools are now in PATH and can now be fired up from any -\\nwhere in the system. I certainly don’t miss the /\\npentest  directory. This certainly makes life a whole \\nlot easier.\\nNo Nessus\\nNessus does not come installed with Kali and is \\nnot available in the Kali repositories. One reason \\nfor this could be that Kali linux is based on Debi -\\nan Wheezy (Debian 7), however if you check the \\navailable downloads from the tenable website, \\nthey have only released a version of Nessus for \\nversion 6 of Debian. Another reason for this may \\nbe because Nessus is more of an audit and com -\\npliance benchmarking tool than a pen-test tool, \\nand perhaps it was thought too bloated to include. \\nNessus is certainly something I see more of in -\\nstalled on dedicated servers these days. Howev -\\ner if you want to install it, the Debian 6 version of \\nNessus which can be downloaded from the ten -\\nable website will still work. The only other pos -\\nsible reason for not including Nessus is that Nes -\\nsus is forbidden in the Penetration Testing with \\nBackTrack(PWB) Course (which will probably \\nadvertisement\\nListing 1.

Offensive \\nSecurity encourages all of its PWB students to \\nuse more specialised and targeted tools to per -\\nform enumeration and discovery. Further, differ -\\nent tools quite often output different results, so it’s \\nbest to use more highly targeted tools in a pen-\\ntest to get specific results rather than the results \\nof a generalised scan or vulnerability assessment \\ntool such as Nessus.\\nOther Notable Changes\\nKali uses Leafpad instead of gedit which is a much \\nlighter weight text editor than gedit. It is also no -\\nticeably faster. But if you want to use gedit it is \\nstill available in the Kali respository with a simple \\napt-get install gedit.  Gedit may appear bloated to \\nsome unless you are interested in syntax highlight -\\ning. Personally I like syntax highlighting, but have \\na habit of writing all my code in vim from the ter -\\nminal window which has this functionality anyway \\n– each to their own I guess. Here’s a list of some \\nother welcome changes:\\n•  The PDF viewer which was used in BackTrack \\nhas now been replaced with Document Viewer \\nwhich is great since I found the PDF viewer a \\nbit lakey.\\n•  You can now easily create your own custom \\nISO of Kali by using Debian live-build scripts.\\n•  Kali comes with VLC player pre-installed which \\nwas not included in BackTrack.\\n•  I’ve also noticed that the ISO image for Kali is \\nalmost 1GB smaller than the BackTrack 5 R3 \\nISO.\\nUpgrading to Future versions of Kali\\nIf you had BackTrack 4 installed and wanted to up -\\ngrade to BackTrack 5, the only way you could have \\nachieved this was to do an entire reinstall. This \\nwould be time consuming, and mean you would \\nhave to re-configure everything back to the way \\nyou wanted it, and customise all your tools again. \\nWith Kali however, an upgrade to future major re -\\nleases can be done by simply issuing the following \\ncommands: Listing 2.\\nThe Kali repository gets its security packages \\nfrom the Debian repository, and all of its tools are \\nnow packaged up to be Debian compliant. \\nListing 2.  Upgrading Kali to the next major distribution\\nroot@kali :~# apt-get update\\nroot@kali :~# apt-get dist-upgradeSummary\\nIn summary, Kali linux feels a lot smoother to \\nwork with than BackTrack, whilst most of the \\ntools remain fairly similar or unchanged; the \\nmain overhaul to be commended on is the over -\\nall improvement in the quality of the distribution \\nfrom the move to Debian. It now feels like a com -\\nplete distribution with far less flakiness and a lot \\nmore stability. For a duck dive into the pen-test \\ntools which ship with Kali, I would recommend \\ndoing Offensive Security’s Penetration Testing \\nwith BackTrack(PWB) course which will familiar -\\nise you with all the tools necessary to conducting \\na complete penetration test with reporting. The \\nmain advantage you will notice is that the tools \\nare now all in path with Kali. The only advice I \\nhave in pursuing this course is to get permission \\nfrom your other half, as it will take a good couple \\nof months out of your life, but is extremely fun, ad -\\ndictive, and rewarding with all the breakthroughs \\nyou will have.

Kali Linux was created for \\nstealth and attack, this amazing distribution is an \\nadvanced and more versatile version of Backtrack \\never created. This distribution is geared towards \\nprofessional penetration testers and security audi -\\ntors. Kali has gone beyond any live cd distro and \\nmoved into the category of a full-fledged operat -\\ning system. It has moved to a solid base of Debi -\\nan modules and is completely File Hierarchy Sys -\\ntem (FHS) compliant. All directories appear under \\nthe main root directory “/”, and have the ability to \\nbe stored and accessed on physical or virtual de -\\nvices. The main “/pentest” directory from previous \\nBacktrack5 release has been removed in this ver -\\nsion named Kali. Now the user can execute any tool \\nfrom anywhere in the file-system, irrespective of its \\ninstalled location. The second advantage of Kali is \\nits support for ARM hardware and ability to boot -\\nstrap the installation directly from the repositories. \\nKali operating system has over three hundred \\npenetration testing tools and wireless device sup -\\nport. Its kernel is highly patched and network \\nservices are disabled by default making it more \\nsecure. Kali is not just for network security profes -\\nsionals, beginners can also start learning about \\ncyber security using this distribution. Whether you \\nare pentesting wireless, exposing server vulner -\\nabilities, performing a web application based ex -\\nploit, learning, or doing social engineering, Kali is \\nthe one-stop-shop for all security needs. Kali is \\nfree and now ported on Android based smartphone \\nto be taken anywhere.\\nKali Linux has many well-known tools like \\nMetasploit, Injection capable wireless drivers, Kis -\\nmet, John, Zap Proxy, Nmap, Ophcrack, Ettercap, \\nHydra, etc. These tools are all categorised in fif -\\nteen different categories for various purposes. The \\nfifteen categories are: Top 10 Security Tools, In -\\nformation Gathering, Vulnerability Analysis, Web \\nApplications, Password Attacks, Wireless Attacks, Exploitation Tools, Sniffing/Spoofing, Maintain -\\ning Access, Reverse Engineering, Stress Testing, \\nHardware Hacking, Forensics, Reporting Tools \\nand System Services. Kali Linux is running Debian \\nXFCE and comes with vim as default text editor. \\nAll the standard applications and accessories are \\npre-installed and ready to run. For weaponizing \\nAndroid platform with Kali Linux, we will require an \\nunlocked & rooted device.\\nHow to unlock the HTC One X Bootloader \\nand Root the device?\\nIt is important to understand the difference be -\\ntween Unlocking the Bootloader and rooting mo -\\nbile devices. Unlocking the Bootloader provides \\nthe user with the option to change the stock oper -\\nating system on the mobile device. However, root -\\ning is the process of modifying or altering the de -\\nfault operating system shipped with the device to \\ngain complete control over it. \\nThis means that the limitations of carriers and \\nvarious manufacturers put on the device is eas -\\nily bypassed, extended functionality is accessed \\nwithout any problems, custom modules and up -\\ngrades can be added without any limitations.

HTC provides instructions on \\ntheir website to unlock the Bootloader for HTC One \\nX, but by performing this operation, the user voids \\nall warranty on the device. The systematic instruc -\\ntions to unlock the Bootloader for HTC One X are \\npresent on the HTC Dev site. Make sure HTC Driv -\\ners are installed on the PC and the mobile phone \\ncan connect and be recognised as HTC Device \\nvia USB cable. Once the device gets connected \\nsuccessfully to the PC, login to the HTCDev web -\\nsite with the registered user name and password. \\nStart by selecting Unlocking Your Bootloader and \\nthen select “All Other Supported Models” under \\nthe Supported Devices section, click Begin Unlock \\nBootloader to start the wizard.\\nThe website prompts to sign a disclaimer that \\nclearly states, the warranty is void and proceed -\\ning further would mean that every repair would be \\ncharged. The website wizard finishes by request -\\ning the device Token ID extracted from the mobile \\nphone. Then based on the Token ID, HTC releases \\nthe unlock code block to release the mobile de -\\nvice. The “unlock.bin” file received is, used to flash \\nthe device and the Bootloader gets unlocked. Next \\nstep is to install SuperSu app, which is an access \\nmanagement tool. Now with root privilege on the \\nmobile device, Kali Linux can be installed.

The \\nscan showed a few open ports on the server, and \\nthis may give us some clues as to where to find \\npotential vulnerabilities. The information which has \\ntaken us back is quite juicy, the server that we are \\nattacking has more of a role assigned, therefore \\nmore points to that attack.Some of the services that are attacked :\\nPort 21 FTP\\nPort 110 pop3\\nPort 3306 mysql\\nThese will probably be the most vulnerable, be -\\ncause the rest of which ports are open on the serv -\\ner have a connection with the security type SSL or \\nTLS, as is the case of HTTPS, SMTPS, POP3S \\nor of the SSH. These protocols and their connec -\\ntion, have a very robust encryption, which is why it \\nis more complex to obtain a key using brute force, \\nor crack a password snifing the trafic on a LAN.\\nAs an example; both by the port 21 as the 110 \\ncould be attempting to perform a brute-force at -\\ntack. On the other hand, we have port 3306 that \\ntells us that mysql installed.\\nWe will do some checking typical to perform a pen -\\netration test, such as trying to access an anonymous \\nuser FTP, or verify access to mysql is enabled.\\nIn Figure 2, shows how the mysql Backend can \\nonly be accessed from within the LAN itself. \\nHowever, having a mysql installed and see so \\nmany open ports makes us think that the web that \\nwe are attacking have more than one database \\ndedicated to various services, for example, for the \\nmain page, a database, for the blog other, and so \\non for each part of the web. This can mean that \\nsome of the parts of the web page is vulnerable.\\nOWASP: Search vulnerabilities\\nOnce that we have some information on the objec -\\ntive, the next step will be to seek vulnerabilities with \\nFigure 2.

At the time of use OWASP we \\ncan use this of two different ways. The first of them \\nwould be to use OWASP as a proxy in our browser, \\nintercepting and all the connections that are made \\nwith Firefox, Chrome, or any other browser.\\nIn this way we can establish the attack in a sin -\\ngle point, that is to say, possibly the web to which \\nwe are attacking has multiple URL, between the \\nBLOG, the main page, the access to the extranet, \\naccess to suppliers, and so on using as a proxy \\nOWASP interceptions exclusively part of the web \\nserver that we want to attack.The other way to use OWASP to search for vul -\\nnerabilities is doing a full scan of the web site.\\nLater I’ll show you how to do it. This option is \\nless advised that the previous one, however, can \\nhelp us in the time to search for these vulnerabili -\\nties, this method is faster. It is less advisable to use \\nthis method, or better said, the handicaps of using \\nas a proxy is, that if you do a full scan on a web -\\nsite, OWASP runs through all the URL of the page \\nand tries to find vulnerabilities in each of the par -\\nties of the web. This implies that the IDS or firewall \\nof server to that we are attacking can detect an in -\\ntrusion attempt.\\nOWASP when perform a full scan, launches all \\npossible attacks, grouping the vulnerabilities found \\nbased on their criticality.\\nIn the image below (Figure 3) we see the result \\nobtained by OWASP on a full scan of the web site \\nthat we are attacking.\\nOnce that we already have the result of the scan -\\nning, the most advisable is to perform a first look \\nat the potential vulnerabilities, and then export it in \\n.HTML in order to be able to focus on those vulner -\\nabilities that we are the most interested in.\\nFigure 4 is the result already exported and in de -\\ntail on the vulnerabilities found. \\nOne of the vulnerabilities found was a XSS (cross \\nsite scripting) and to exploit it is as simple as go \\nto the browser and insert the URL which showed \\nOWASP.

The final solution must scale with grow -\\ning business demands for security assessments so \\nautomation of distributed scanners was a primary \\nconsideration. Additionally, the scanners must be \\ncost-effective to deploy, easy to manage (more on \\nthis later), and enable centralized reporting.\\nHaving familiarity with the Backtrack Linux distri -\\nbution, Kali was a logical choice for a best of breed \\noffering in the open source community. So what \\nis Kali Linux? According to Kali.org, Kali Linux is \\nan advanced Penetration Testing and Security Au -\\nditing Linux distribution.  It is also a complete re-\\nbuild of Backtrack, its predecessor. Kali is free ( as \\nin beer ) and contains over 300 penetration testing \\ntools. This seems like a good fit for the low-cost re -\\nquirement of the project.\\nTo further control costs, the Raspberry Pi system \\non a chip (SoC) device was selected as the comput -\\ner hardware for the scanners. These tiny computers \\ncan be purchased from a number of distributors for \\n$35.00USD. It must be recognized at this point that \\nchoosing a low-powered device like the RPi is not \\nwithout trade-offs. We are seeking to balance cost, \\nsize, and power efficiency against performance re -\\nquirements and capabilities of the system. That be -\\ning said, it’s hard to argue that a better value can be \\nhad for a distributed network scanner. \\nWhat’s a Raspberry Pi?\\nAccording to the official website ( http://www.raspber -\\nrypi.org/faqs) , “the Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized \\ncomputer that plugs into your TV and a keyboard. It’s \\na capable little PC which can be used for many of the \\nthings that your desktop PC does, like spreadsheets, \\nword-processing and games. It also plays high-def -\\ninition video. We want to see it being used by kids all over the world to learn programming.” Hardware \\nSpecifications (Raspberry Pi Model B):\\n•  CPU – 700 MHz ARM processor (overclocks to \\n1 GHz)\\n•  Storage – SD card slot\\n•  Memory – 512MB RAM\\n•  Graphics – Broadcom VideoCore IV\\n•  Video Out – Composite RCA and HDMI\\n•  Audio Out – 3.5mm jack \\n•  Networking – 10/100Mbps Ethernet\\n•  I/O Ports – 2x USB\\nFigure 1. Raspberry Pi Model B\\nDesigned as a project computer, the Raspberry Pi \\nappeared to be a good it for our speciic require -\\nments. I followed the documentation on Kali.org \\nfor installing Kali ARM on a Raspberry Pi. Since \\nthis is a proof of concept, an 8GB SDHC Class 10 \\ncard was used for provisioning the operating sys -\\ntem.

It is often said that installing open \\nsource systems is not for the faint of heart. I agree. \\nWhile not always straightforward, a bit of Google-\\nfu usually saves the day…no exceptions here.\\nNote\\nI experienced problems with the kali-linux-1.0.4-\\narmel-rpi.img.gz version of the operating system \\n(the current version) which resulted in the key -\\nboard and mouse locking up in the desktop inter -\\nface.

This is the path I took in order \\nto make progress on the task at hand.\\nSome initial hardware problems were experi -\\nenced due to drawing too much power from the \\nUSB ports. For example, my Apple USB keyboard \\nwas detected by the operating system, but would \\nnot work. This was resolved by using a powered \\nUSB hub to offload the power draw. Trying a differ -\\nent keyboard worked fine without the hub, so your \\nmileage will vary. This is only of concern when ini -\\ntially configuring the RPi. A mouse and keyboard \\nwill not be used when the device is running on the \\nclient’s network. If you need the hub during pro -\\nduction, the Raspberry Pi can be powered off of \\nthe same USB hub adding additional power to the \\nmouse/keyboard. This is how I ran the device dur -\\ning my testing and eliminated the need for an ad -\\nditional power supply.\\nAlso, the default install does not fully utilize the \\nSD card which led to errors due to a full disk when \\nperforming updates. This was resolved by us -\\ning the fdisk followed by the resize2fs  utilities to \\nexpand the system partition to use the remain -\\ning free space. Exact details for this can be found \\nhere:  http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/ques -\\ntions/499/how-can-i-resize-my-root-partition .\\nBased on my experience here, some other soft -\\nware housekeeping items are needed (Listing 1)…\\nListing 1.  General Kali updates\\n#apt-get update – performs general software \\nupdates\\n#apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-goodies – installs \\nitems need to support the xserver GUI\\n#apt-get install iceweasel – installs the \\ndefault browser\\nWith the initial hiccups of the installation behind \\nme, the next step was to consider what tools from \\nthe new Kali system would be deployed to perform \\nthe network vulnerability scans. With so many ca -\\npabilities packed into this Linux security distro, \\nthere was no shortage of options.\\nRunning startx  from the command prompt cranks \\nup the desktop interface. Even if we will not normal -\\nly run our scripts and programs from the GUI, it is \\nhelpful to drive the system around a bit to familiarize \\nourselves with the tools loaded on the Kali platform. \\nBe prepared to grab a cup of coffee when first start -\\ning the graphic interface. The slower processing \\npower of the Raspberry box takes a few minutes to \\nload the desktop the first time. Patience is rewarded \\nwith the familiar Kali/Backtrack dragon logo.Selecting a Scanner\\nWith over 300 security tools available on the Ka -\\nli system, we must narrow down which tool (or \\ntools) to use for our purposes. Here are some of \\nthe requirements:\\n•  Scheduled scans for multiple clients,\\n•  lexibility in coniguration,\\n•  available (free) updates to vulnerability deinitions,\\n•  multiple options for reporting output,\\n•  secure transmission of reports (more on this to \\nfollow).\\nLet’s examine these requirements a bit more. Since \\nthe concept here is to create a set of distributed \\nscanners at various client sites, the system must be \\nable to run as a scheduled task and will ultimate -\\nly be called from a master script. Having lexibili -\\nty with its coniguration, the software should adapt \\nwell to changes in solution requirements over time. \\nFreely available vulnerability deinition updates will \\nkeep costs down while allowing the system to de -\\ntect ever-evolving system threats. The tool should \\nprovide multiple options for reporting output. Initially \\nreports will be generated in basic HTML or PDF for -\\nmats, but future requirements will necessitate cap -\\nturing granular scanning data for developing a more \\nsophisticated (eventual) self-service customer por -\\ntal. From a security standpoint, we are not storing \\nePHI; however, we are storing information sensitive \\nto the internal structure and systems of our clients’ \\nnetworks. As such, precautions to secure transmis -\\nsion of reports will be established as part of the so -\\nlution. For the reasons described above, I select -\\ned OpenVAS as the scanning tool for this proof of \\nconcept. No one system will be one hundred per -\\ncent effective all of the time. Certain vulnerabilities \\nwill be missed while some false-positives may be \\nreported. Remember – risk “reduction” is the goal \\nas risk “elimination” is an unreasonable expecta -\\ntion. The important thing is we are using the tool as \\npart of an overall security effort. A more attractive \\noption would be to deploy multiple scanning tools to \\nvalidate the results and cover gaps that exist from \\na single software solution. For the purposes of this \\nphase of the project, we will stick to using a single \\ntool for scanning and reporting.\\nWorking with OpenvAS\\nI ran my out-of-the-box OpenVAS install from the \\ndesktop and fired up the setup script included with \\nthe GUI menu options.

Migrating the database\\nAfter performing the above, I still go an error stat -\\ning “ERROR: OpenVAS Manager is NOT running!” \\nTo double-check for listening services, I ran the \\ncommand: netstat -A inet –ntlp . As the OpenVAS \\nManager (openvasmd) was found to be listening \\non its default port, I ignored the “error” and pro -\\nceeded with testing (Figure 3).\\nSetting up the Scans\\nThe obligatory disclaimer: I am not an attorney; \\nhowever, I used to work for some. Be sure you have expressed written permission to perform any \\npenetration tests, vulnerability scans, or enumer -\\nation of network services and host information. \\nConducting security scans without permission is \\nagainst the law and not advocated here. For test -\\ning purposes, I have used my home network and \\nmy employer’s network (with permission) to run \\nthe scans. Enough said about that.\\nSetting up a scan is simply a matter of managing \\n(at a minimum): Tasks, Targets, and Scan Configs.\\nTasks – scan jobs made up of the other ele -\\nments. The tasks can be scheduled and leverage \\nEscalators, such as send an email when the task \\nis complete.\\nTargets – IP addresses or ranges of the network \\ndevices to scan. This can be a single Target con -\\nfiguration for a simple network or multiple (servers, \\nworkstations, network devices). Multiple targets \\nwould be useful when it is desirable to customize the \\nlevel of scanning based on different device types.\\nScan Configs – preset vulnerability scan con -\\nfigurations using different levels of scanning tech -\\nniques. As the more intrusive configs can bring \\ndown hosts, use caution when making decisions \\non how and when to run the scans.\\nFor this exercise, I set up three separate scan \\ntargets – our workstation network, our server net -\\nwork, and one for my work computer. I then creat -\\ned three tasks to scan the targets named – “Scan \\nworkstations – Full and fast”, “Scan servers – Full \\nand fast”, and “Scan my PC” respectively. For each \\nof these I used the Full and Fast scan option. This \\nwas the least invasive of the default set of scan \\nconfigurations. The overall process is straightfor -\\nward as the Greenbone Security Desktop interface \\nis intuitive in its layout. Several tabs at the bottom \\nof the application window delineate the various ar -\\neas for configuration.\\nI chose to run the scans manually and did not \\nschedule them. The time required to perform the \\nscans will vary based on the number of hosts being \\nscanned in the current task and the performance \\nof the scanner and network. Just to get an idea of \\nthe traffic generated during a scan, I ran Wireshark \\non my laptop to watch the vulnerability scans. Fur -\\nther analysis of the packets would reveal the mag -\\nic behind the scanning process (Figure 4).\\nHardware Performance\\nLet’s suffice it to say, the performance of the Rasp -\\nberry Pi is underwhelming in this application. This \\nis not unexpected actually and, to a certain degree, \\ninsignificant. While the speed of the scans could \\nbe increased by using faster hardware, we desire \\ninexpensive  and good enough .

Further performance gains would be real -\\nized by running OpenVAS from the command line \\nonly and not from the GUI. In a distributed scanner \\nmodel, the desktop interface would only be used \\non the reporting server. In a real-world application, \\nI would choose to spend a little more on a signifi -\\ncantly faster device (and still stay below $100 per \\nscanner). Some attractive RPi alternatives for the \\nARM processor platform include the Beagle Bone \\nBlack and the Odroid U2.\\nAnalyzing the Results\\nOnce the scan(s) were finished, it was time to eval -\\nuate the results. In this case, we will look at a scan \\non my work laptop (a Windows 7 computer). I used \\nthe HTML version of the report although there are \\nother options including XML, PDF and text.\\nThe Host Summary area of the report provides a \\nhigh-level view of the number of vulnerabilities de -\\ntected and the threat level – High, Medium, or Low. \\nSince I used the Full and Fast scanning option, I as -\\nsumed the threat count would be fairly low. More in -\\nvasive scans would likely show more threats at the \\nexpense of time and higher network activity. For the \\ntest scan, the results show zero High level threats, \\ntwo Medium and seven Low level. A port summary \\nof the detected threats is shown Figure 5.\\nLet’s take a look at one of the Medium level threats. \\nThe same process will be used to examine each \\nthreat to determine a remediation plan for the cli -\\nent. One of the threats detected is called “NVT: DCE \\nServices Enumeration” on TCP port 135. A bit of re -search on the threat shows Windows computers use \\nthis port to look up various services running on a re -\\nmote computer and is used for remote management \\nof the device.

OpenVAS HTML Report, Security Issues\\nCentralized Reporting\\nOpenVAS is designed to leverage remote slave \\nscanners. This allows for the Greenbone Security \\nDesktop and the underlying OpenVAS components \\nto perform the heavy lifting of the remote scanning. \\nThe advantage of this capability is using a single in -\\nterface for scheduling scans and reporting. A cen -\\ntralized OpenVAS server can be used to manage \\nthe entire system. The distributed aspect of the solu -\\ntion will allow my security consulting service to scale \\nefficiently without unneeded visits to client sites. \\nWith direct access to all client reports, I can work di -\\nrectly with our managed services team to implement \\nthe remediations. While certainly a great feature, the \\nproblem with the solution is requiring multiple VPN \\nconnections into the networks of our medical clients. \\nThis risk can be mitigated by using a DMZ for the \\nOpenVAS master server and scheduling the scans \\nin a way where only one client VPN connection is re -\\nquired at a time. Leveraging on-demand VPN con -\\nnections in conjunction with an idle timeout would be \\nthe best configuration to eliminate these concerns.\\nNote\\nDue to the timeline for writing this article, the remote \\nscanning capability of OpenVAS was not tested.\\nFuture enhancements\\nAs with any project like this, there is always room \\nfor improvement. Future requirements to increase \\nremote system capabilities will likely push beyond \\nthe limits of the Raspberry Pi hardware. In that \\ncase, other slightly more expensive hardware so -\\nlutions could be considered without completely re -\\ninventing the wheel. For example, many other SoC \\nsystems are on the market with higher processor \\nspeeds and more memory than the RPi. As these \\ndevices use the same processor family as RPi, it \\nis expected Kali ARM support will enable use of \\nthese more capable hardware systems. Some like -\\nly future enhancements include:\\n•  packet captures of Internet trafic to keep a roll -\\ning history of network activity in the event of a \\nbreach,•  leverage additional scanning tools to validate \\nOpenVAS scans,\\n•  harden the Kali install to protect locally stored \\nvulnerability reports,\\n•  deploy a client self-service portal to view a his -\\ntory of scans and vulnerability remediation.\\nSummary\\nThis project started as a proof of concept to deter -\\nmine the viability of using open source tools like Kali \\nto deploy distributed network vulnerability scanners \\non low-cost hardware. The business case for this so -\\nlution is to provide value-added consulting services \\nto our medical clients and reduce risk as part of a \\ncomprehensive HIPAA compliance program. The ex -\\nperiences outlined here demonstrate that Raspber -\\nry Pi and Kali make an effective hardware/software \\nplatform for network scans. As is to be expected with \\nan open source project, more effort and technical \\nknowledge is required to deploy (and maintain) the \\nsolution; however, the long-term return on investment \\nmakes the endeavor worthwhile. The end goal is to \\nhave a completely automated and low-cost scanning \\nsolution where all parties have direct access to the \\nreports for compliance and remediation purposes. \\nThis proof of concept using Kali shows that the end \\ngoal is certainly within reach.\\nHIPAA Terms\\nCovered Entity – a healthcare provider, a health \\nplan, or healthcare clearinghouse.\\nBusiness Associate – a person or entity that per -\\nforms certain functions or activities that involve the \\nuse or disclosure of protected health information on \\nbehalf of, or provides services to, a covered entity.\\nElectronic Protected Health Information (e-PHI) \\n– individually identifiable health information is \\nthat which can be linked to a particular person. \\nCommon identifiers of health information include \\nnames, social security numbers, addresses, and \\nbirth dates.\\nCHARLIe WATeRS \\nCharlie Waters serves as the Security Oicer \\nand Senior Consultant for Ininity Network \\nSolutions, a Georgia-based MSP irm.

In that case some \\nearn the money through bad methods or some \\nby good methods. So, as a hacker I don’t support \\npeople earning money with bad methodologies. \\nNow with the depth of hacking, some big com -\\npanies over the Internet like Facebook, Google, \\nFirefox, and many more opened up a scheme of \\nbug bounties in which hackers from all over the \\nworld are invited to find out a bug or vulnerability \\nin their services, which if found they pay them with \\nhigh bounties for their hard + smart work. To find \\nout those bugs hackers have to use some meth -\\nodologies either based on command line or GUI \\nbased interfaces. Therefore in order to fulfill this \\ndemand of hackers, another type of Operating sys -\\ntem called Kali Linux came into the market which is \\nan extension to Backtrack. Now Kali Linux is very \\nmuch helpful for penetration testing and vulnerabil -\\nity assessments. I am going to show the various \\ntools that can be used for penetration testing and \\nalso for attacking.

Let me just clear this \\nconcept that Kali Linux is a complete re-building of \\nthe Backtrack Linux distributions which is based \\nupon the Debian platform. Now Kali Linux is an ad -\\nvance version of OS which is used for penetration \\ntesting and security auditing Linux distributions. \\nThis is also an open source OS which is available \\nfreely on the Internet. So that anyone can down -\\nload from the Internet. \\nFeatures of Kali Linux\\nSome of the features that makes Kali much more \\ncompatible and useful than any other Linux distri -\\nbutions. \\n•  Kali Linux come up with 300+ penetration test -\\ning tools which are enough to audit any OS, \\nany website or web apps.\\n•  Much more powerful and faster than Backtrack.\\n•  In Backtrack many tools didn’t work which are \\neliminated in Kali.\\n•  Open source and freely available on Internet.\\n•  Kali Linux is much more compatible with wire -\\nless devices.\\n•  Comes in a package of multi languages so that \\nevery person can enjoy assessments in their \\nown language.KALI LINUX\\nA Solution to HACKINg/SeCURITY\\nToday is the world of technology and everyone somehow is \\nattached to it. Some are using the technology for the good \\npurpose and some are using it for bad purposes and Internet \\nis one of those technologies which define both my statements. \\nInternet is being used both by the good (the White Hats) and \\nthe bad (the Black Hats).

The \\ndefault username and password to enter into the \\nKali is same as that of backtrack – username – \\nroot and password – toor (Figure 1). This is how exactly the Kali looks when you en -\\nter to the main desktop. Just reject the folders. \\nNow this is my Kali installed in the virtual ma -\\nchine and I am not wasting the time in the instal -\\nlation process because people are smart enough \\nto carry out the installation of any operating sys -\\ntem. So, let’s just focus on our main task. Just \\nlook at the top-right corner of the window it will \\nshow that who is currently logged into your sys -\\ntem (Figure 2).\\nNow moving on to the next, the very first task \\nwhen you enter into the Kali is to check whether \\nthe Internet connection is working fine or not. Be -\\nlow in the snapshot just look at the cursor at the \\ntop right corner showing the wired network which \\nmeans the Internet is working fine in the virtual ma -\\nchine with NAT enabled (Figure 3).\\nNow let’s get familiar with the terminal. In win -\\ndows there is a command prompt from where the \\nwhole system can be assessable, in Linux there \\nis something called as terminal which is a based \\nupon the command line interface from where the \\nwhole system can be viewed. In order to open the \\nterminal just follow the path as – “Applications > \\nAccessories > terminal” and from there you can \\nsimply copy the terminal to the desktop like I did, \\nso that every time the user doesn’t have to go \\nthere, he just come in and click on the terminal to \\naccess it (Figure 4). \\nFigure 1.

For an instance let’s say \\nI have run a service called apache2 for my lo -\\ncal-host then I will type, “service apache2 \\nstart” (Figure 6). And in order to check wheth -\\ner the service has been successfully started or \\nnot. Just start your Internet browser and write \\n“127.0.0.1” which is a loopback address which shows the successful working of the Apache \\nserver (Figure 7).\\n•  In order to open the Internet browser through \\nthe terminal, just enter “Firefox &” and it will \\nopen the browser and also shows that what ex -\\nactly the PID (process ID) for this browser pro -\\ncess has been allocated (Figure 8). \\n•  If the root wants to change the password of his \\naccount, he can simply do it by entering the \\ncommand, “passwd” and enter the password it \\nwill change the password from default “toor” to \\nsay “123” (Figure 9)\\nTill now we have seen some of the important \\ncommands which make a user friendly with the \\nLinux terminal. Some more commands which are \\nvery helpful for any user to get started with the \\nLinux and those are:\\n•  ls – list the iles and folders of the current di -\\nrectory\\n•  cd – change directory\\n•  touch – to make a ile\\n•  mkdir – to create a directory\\n•  rm – removes the iles, rm -R removes iles \\nand directories\\n•  rmdir – removes the empty directories\\n•  man – open the manual for the commands\\n•  time – to see the current time\\nFigure 6.

Now let us just get back to our main \\nmotive but before irst let me make everyone fa -\\nmiliar with some of the terminologies which will \\nhelp everyone to understand the basic concept \\nbehind the scene.\\nNow in order to begin with any kind of hacking \\nevery person has to go through some phases and \\nthose phases are knows as the hacking phases \\nand those are:\\nSteps Performed by Hackers:\\nThere are only five steps in order to hack anything \\nin this world:\\n•  Information Gathering\\n•  Scanning\\n•  Gaining Access\\n•  Maintaining Access\\n•  Covering Tracks\\nIn order to explore more about these hacking \\nsteps let’s just check from where all the tools can \\nbe accessed in GUI interface (Figure 10). \\nNow there are more than 300+ tools in Kali Linux \\nwhich will help to acquire the remote systems, \\ngenerating your own payloads, addition of latest \\nexploits, scanning process and much more. Now \\nit is not possible for me also to explore each and \\nevery tool in the tool list but what I am going to do \\nhere is sticking to the main concept and will going \\nto show the main tools which will make a person \\nfamiliar with the Kali and it will also make them free \\nto use the tools of their own.\\nInformation gathering\\nthe very first step in order to gather each and ev -\\nery information about the target, only then a tes -\\nter can examine the whole bunch of vulnerabili -\\nties and can patch them easily and safely. Now \\nthe major source of gathering the information is \\nGoogle which is an open source and is available \\nfor each person. But the information gathering de -\\npends upon:\\n•  Active gathering- which completely means a \\nuser is interacting with the target directly. For \\nan instance – making a phone call to a friend \\nworking in the target company and gathering \\nthe information by spooing your own friend.•  Passive gathering – in which a user is not di -\\nrectly interacting with the target means collect -\\ning the information from search engines like \\nGoogle or Bing (Figure 11). \\nNow the main task is to gather the IP (Internet \\nProtocol) address which is a 32-bit unique num -\\nber and is being assigned to everyone. The best \\nmethod is to ping a website and gather the IP ad -\\ndress. Although the ping is used for checking the \\nwhether the host is alive or not but here we are \\nquite stick to our own method. So, if your target is \\nFigure 13.  Options in Dmitry\\nFigure 12.

The tool that I am using here is \\n“dmitry” which is completely based on command \\nline but very easy to use and even give the results \\nfaster and accurate.\\nSo in order to use dmitry simply run the following \\ncommand (Figure 13-15):\\n<dmitry –winsepfb –t 0-9 –e IP>\\nNow in this particular scan I have targeted the \\nGoogle and it shows the scan results that all the \\n150 ports are in a closed state. You can simply \\nput as many as options you want.Scanning\\nThe second most important phase to find out the \\nservices that are vulnerable, the open ports, and \\nmany other types of types of services which are \\nvulnerable in windows, websites, routers, and net -\\nworks etc. therefore, scanning is broadly divided \\ninto major three parts:\\n•  Port scanning: In this method the attacker will \\nsend a number of messages to break into the \\ncomputer so that he can get the information \\nabout the computer’s network.\\n•  Network Scanning: To check the number of ac -\\ntive hosts on the network.\\n•  Vulnerability scanning: Means to check the \\nweaknesses in the target so that it attacker us -\\nes those to gain the access of the target\\nSo now I am going to use the universal vulner -\\nability scanner which gives the best output for \\nscanning process and is an open source avail -\\nable freely on the Internet and the tool known is \\nnmap which is responsible a number of inger -\\nprinting, service ingerprinting and numerous \\nTCP scan, stealth scan, UDP scan, PORT scan \\nand many more. \\nFigure 14.

Command used is: namp \\n-sT IPaddress (Figure 17).\\nexploitation\\nGaining Access or exploitation means to acquire \\nany computer system, control panel of any website \\nor any network without someone’s permission. The \\nattacker in this phase attacks on the systems to \\ngain the access and steals the important informa -\\ntion about the company which he wants to exploit. \\nThe exploit can occur in LAN (Local Area Network), \\nin a WAN (Wide Area Network) and also it can also \\noccur offline like REVERSE ENGINEERING, Buf -\\nfer Overflow Attacks, Password Filtering etc. \\nNow in this particular phase I am going to exploit \\nmy own WIN-7 just to show how the exploitation \\ncan be done through Kali Linux in much faster way \\nthan Backtrack.\\nBefore going deep into the exploitation let me \\nclear some of the basic terminologies so that there \\nshould be no confusion while going through attack -\\ning phase.\\n•  Threat: A threat is potential violation of the se -\\ncurity.\\n•  Vulnerability: It is the weakness in the design of \\nan application or any website that can lead to \\ncompromising with the security of the system or \\nthe network or any web based application.\\n•  Attack: To set up a violence force.\\n•  Exploit: It means to breach the security of the \\nIT (Info. Tech.) System through the vulnerabili -\\nty.\\n•  Payload: Payloads in computer security are re -\\nlated to malicious iles (generally .exe) which \\nperform malicious activity.\\n•  Reverse TCP connection: A reverse connec -\\ntion actually made to bypass the restrictions \\nthat the irewall has applied on the open ports. \\nA irewall actually blocks the incoming trafic \\nthrough the open ports but could not block the \\noutgoing trafic. So, the attacker use this way \\nto bypass the security restrictions.\\nThings Required\\n•  KALI LINUX UPDATED METASPLOIT.\\n•  An intermediate to upload your payload (I am \\nusing DROPBOX and SHARE FOLDER of KA -\\nLI LINUX).Brief Description about the Metasploit\\nMetasploit (also known as MS) is basically an open \\nsource framework that contains all the exploits, \\npayloads, helpful in penetration testing and also \\nhelpful in IDS signature development. MSF actual -\\nly contains the database of the exploit codes which \\nwhen hit on any PC inside or outside the network \\nwith the concerned vulnerabilities, produce a shell \\nat that targeted PC and returns back to the attack -\\ner’s machine.\\nSo, let’s get started with the exploitation phase: \\n•  Open up the terminal and invoke the Metasploit \\nconsole by running the command called \\nmsfconsole  and wait for 1-2 minutes as it takes time \\nto load all the payloads, exploits etc (Figure 18). \\nFigure 20.

In \\nthis step the attacker leaves himself an easier way in order to come back to into the system lat -\\ner. By this step of hacking an attacker can come \\nto the gained system anytime even if the service \\nhe exploited is patched. The Metasploit Persis -\\ntent Meterpreter Service is what an attacker usu -\\nally uses, but there’s warning when you use this \\npersistent Meterpreter requires no authentication. \\nBut this will have a problem. Any other attacker \\nwho uses the same service will also have the \\nsame port address to maintain the access which \\nis not a right thing. \\nCovering tracks\\nCovering tracks is a last phase of hacking. Cover -\\ning tracks refers to the actions that are being un -\\ndertaken by an attacker to widen his exploitation of \\nthe system without being detected. Now the rea -\\nson behind covering tracks is to be on the safer \\nside and also include the prolonged stay and con -\\ntinued use of resources. \\nConclusion\\nIn the end I would only like to conclude that in \\nthe depth of crisis, hacking over the INTERNET \\nis still a very big problem. Some hackers do it for \\nthe sake of fun or some do it for the sake of tak -\\ning revenge. Therefore, KALI is the solution of all \\nthese answers.

For heart disease, there are some risk factors that you can’t change, but many that you can. You can’t change a family history of early heart disease or your age, which for women becomes a risk factor at age 55. Men are at higher risk beginning at age 45. \\nEvery risk factor counts, and if you have more than \\none, they can “gang up” and worsen each other’\\ns \\neffects. But most risk factors can be controlled with changes in lifestyle. Sometimes medication is also needed. Here’s a quick review of these risk factors. \\nSmoking. Smoking leads to reduced blood flow in the \\narteries. \\nThis reduced flow can lead to a heart attack. \\nThere’s no safe way to smoke. However, the benefits of \\nquitting start immediately. After a few days, your blood pressure will drop and the levels of oxygen and carbon monoxide in the blood can return to normal. Just 1 year after quitting, your heart disease risk will drop by more than half. It’s not easy to quit, but make a plan and you can do it. Or try an organized program or medication—ask your doctor if either is right for you. \\nHigh blood pressure. Also called hypertension, high \\nblood pressure increases your risk of heart disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure. \\nEven levels slightly \\nabove normal—called prehypertension—increase your heart disease risk. \\nA Healthy Heart IN BRIEF: \\nYour Guide to \\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES \\nNational Institutes of Health \\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \\n'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Pdf/06-5715.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='There are several ways to get your blood pressure under \\ncontrol. Follow a heart healthy eating plan, r educe \\nyour salt and sodium intake, get regular physical activity, \\nand maintain a healthy weight. If you drink alcoholic \\nbeverages, do so in moderation—one drink per day for \\nwomen and two per day for men. Your doctor may also \\nrecommend medication to lower your blood pressure. \\nHigh blood cholesterol. Excess cholesterol and fat in your \\nblood build up in the walls of the vessels that supply \\nblood to the heart. \\nThis buildup, called plaque, can lead \\nto blockages. A lipoprotein profile tests your levels of \\ntotal cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad” \\ncholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or “good” \\ncholesterol, and triglycerides—a fatty substance in the blood. \\nYou can lower your cholesterol by following a heart \\nhealthy eating plan, being physically active, maintaining \\na healthy weight, and, if needed, taking medication. \\nOverweight/obesity. The high rate of overweight and \\nobesity in our country is no secret. \\nBut size isn’t the \\nonly issue. Excess weight can increase the risk of not \\nonly heart disease, but a host of other conditions, such \\nas stroke, gallbladder disease, arthritis, and some can -\\ncers. Even a small amount of weight loss (10 percent of \\nyour initial weight) will help lower your heart disease \\nrisk. \\nIf you are overweight, at the very least, try not to \\ngain more weight. Lasting weight loss requires a change in lifestyle. Adopt \\na healthy\\n, lower calorie eating plan, and be more \\nphysically active. Aim to lose no more than 1/2 pound \\nto 2 pounds per week. If you have a lot of weight to \\nlose, ask your doctor, a registered dietitian, or a \\nqualified nutritionist to help. \\nPhysical inactivity. Even if you have no other risk \\nfactors, being physically inactive greatly boosts your \\nchances of developing heart-related problems. \\nBut \\nnearly 40 percent of Americans do no spare-time \\nphysical activity at all. \\nTry to do at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity \\nphysical activity on most, if not all, days of the week. \\nThis includes brisk walking, light weightlifting, or even \\nhousecleaning or gardening. \\nIf you need to, divide the 30 \\nminutes into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each. \\nDiabetes. About 11 million Americans have been \\ndiagnosed with diabetes—and another 5.7 million don’\\nt \\nknow they have it. About two-thirds of those with \\ndiabetes die of heart or blood vessel disease. \\nDiabetes can be detected with a blood sugar test. If you \\nhave diabetes, it is vital that you keep it under control. \\nModest changes in diet and level of physical activity \\ncan often prevent or delay the development of diabetes. \\nTaking Action \\nThe first step to improving your heart health is learning \\nabout your risk profile. See the box “Questions To Ask \\nYour Doctor.” Then begin taking the steps to heart \\nhealth—don’t smoke, follow a heart healthy eating \\nplan, be physically active, and maintain a healthy \\nweight. Start today to keep your heart strong. \\nTo Learn More \\nContact the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \\n(NHLBI) for information and publications on heart \\ndisease and heart health. \\nNHLBI Health Information Center \\nP.O.
